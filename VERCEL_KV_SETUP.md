# Vercel KV Setup Guide

## Step 1: Create Vercel KV Database
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to your project
3. Go to "Storage" tab
4. Click "Create Database"
5. Choose "KV" (Redis)
6. Select a region close to you
7. Click "Create"

## Step 2: Get Environment Variables
After creating the KV database, Vercel will automatically add these environment variables to your project:
- `KV_URL`
- `KV_REST_API_URL`
- `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`
- `KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN`

## Step 3: Deploy
The environment variables are automatically added to your project. Just deploy and it will work!
